# STAHZAI
SciRe 2024-25 Project

---------------------

For our project, we are developing an AI model that can analyze star images to classify the star type, color, luminosity, and composition. Using some equation, it would predict the distance to its habitable zone (if we get far enough, more helpful features). The model will process both the visual and size characteristics of stars, so we plan on using Python neural networks for image classification and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for the spectral data. This project is grounded in the fact that stars are classified based on their spectral types (O, B, A, F, G, K, M), which correspond to temperature and luminosity, key factors in determining the location of their habitable zones. The habitable zone is the region around a star where liquid water could potentially exist on a planet, making it crucial in the search for exoplanets.

The results of this experiment could be applied in astronomy to identify stars with potentially habitable exoplanets by predicting where their habitable zones are located. This could make the search for Earth-like planets much easier and more efficient, assisting astronomers in focusing their resources on stars most likely to harbor life-supporting planets. Additionally, the AI model can contribute to the growing world of AI and space research by demonstrating how machine learning can improve the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical data analysis. It may even expand to identify other important characteristics of stars that might assist astronomers even better (hopefully NASA is benefited!!)

**BIG QUESTION: Can an AI model accurately predict star composition, classification (if we get far enough then also habitable zone) by analyzing an image of a star and its size data?**
